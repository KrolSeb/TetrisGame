## General info / Inspiration

Some time ago I increased my Javascript programming knowledge.
I created this project in order to put the acquired skills into practice.
I also wanted to implement the game to be able to rest during breaks in programming :).

I was inspired by tutorial on Youtube, mainly to program the game logic - here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2aW5V46khA" target="_blank">link</a>.

## Technologies

- Javascript
- HTML 5
- CSS 3 (SCSS)
- Bootstrap 4

## List of changes

List of features ready:

- rewritten and refactored game logic code from tutorial,
- added welcome view used to choose game mode,
- added loading game view,
- updated game view elements(score and lines information, countdown counter),
- added dynamic resized canvas depending on the device screen resolution,
- added end game view,
- created new design and logos for views,
- added support for mobile devices (e.g. sidebar with statistics, steering buttons),
- migrated stylesheet code from CSS to SCSS.

To-do list for future development:

- game levels and increase game speed after level change,
- add database used to store game scores, 
- add Node.js to project - used to operate on database,
- drop piece to bottom after space key or button press.
